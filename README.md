java.handlebars
===============

A Java implementation of the [Handlebars] templating language. The project began as a small component of a Java webserver, but is complete enough to use wherever Handlebars-style template parsing is desired.

This implementation comes with two components:
* Handlebars template parser
* JSON wrapper
